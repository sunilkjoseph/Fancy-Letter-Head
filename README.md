# Fancy Letterheaded Paper Project

This project is a hands-on exercise based on the "Building blocks" tutorial from Mozilla Developer Network (MDN). The goal is to create a letterheaded paper template using HTML and CSS, incorporating the concepts and techniques explained in the MDN tutorial.

## Project Description

The project involves the creation of a stylish letterheaded paper with specific design elements applied using CSS. The main letter section includes a white background with a semi-transparent gradient, fixed top and bottom images, and a 1mm border. The logo, styled as per the tutorial, is applied to the `<h1>` element with a subtle drop shadow.
